Greasemonkey Scripts
====================

This is a little collection of the greasemonkey scripts which i wrote.

Translator-menu
---------------
This script offers a simple context-menu to translate several words between
english and german. It uses dict.cc as the data-source. dict.cc is a rapidly
growing dictionary which is mainly filled by it's users, so you can find a lot
of slang-terms there, too.

To use this context-menu need greasemonkey and  have to install the following
script. Then you can select any word on a website and press CTRL plus the
right-key of your mouse to search for translations of this word.
