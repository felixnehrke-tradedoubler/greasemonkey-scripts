Greasemonkey Scripts
====================

This is a little collection of the greasemonkey scripts which i wrote.

These scripts are developed to run in [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) and should run in [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome/Chromium) as well.
But I can't promise that they run in Tampermonkey because I do only test in Greasemonkey.

Translator-menu
---------------
This script offers a simple context-menu to translate several words between
english and german. It uses dict.cc as the data-source. dict.cc is a rapidly
growing dictionary which is mainly filled by it's users, so you can find a lot
of slang-terms there, too.

To use this context-menu need
[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ "Firefox") or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en "Chrome")
and  have to install the following script. Then you can select any word on a
website and press CTRL plus the right-key of your mouse to search for
translations of this word.

Gmail Image Correction
----------------------
This script resizes inline-images in gmail if the size of the image exceed the
possible page width.

To enjoy this improvement you need
[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ "Firefox") or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en "Chrome")
and have to install the following script.

Better watchseriestv.to
-----------------------------
Use this script to get a better user experience on watchseriestv.to. This
script replaces the webplayer and the hundreds of anoying popups by a direct
download-prompt to view the episode in the video player of your choice.

Currently the following video-providers are supported (others will come soon):
- gorillavid.in
- vodlocker.com
- movpod.in
- daclips.in

Still in development
- vidspot.net
- allmyvideos.net
- movreel.com

To enhance your experience you need
[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ "Firefox") or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en "Chrome")
and have to install the following script.
